# A HubTagFilter is applied to all FeedItems in a Hub. It is applied first in the filter chain, and can be overridden by HubFeedTagFilters or HubFeedItemTagFilters as they are more specific than this one.
#
# This filter is a great way to clean up and remove spurious tags in your Hub. You can also add tags at this level, but it doesn't seem all that useful to apply a tag to everything you're aggregating.
